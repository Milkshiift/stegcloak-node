### StegCloak fork optimized specifically for node.js usage   
Uses only 2 dependencies instead of the original 15 by removing everything that is not needed for API usage from the Node.js environment.    
Also uses the [Rambda](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rambda) library instead of [Ramda](https://ramdajs.com/) to reduce the size of the bundle and improve performance.
